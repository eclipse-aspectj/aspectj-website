			    by Ramnivas Laddad</p>
			    <p>It is time to move from AOP theory and toy examples to AOP practice and real applications. 
			    With this unique book you can make that move. It teaches you AOP concepts, the AspectJ language, 
			    and how to develop industrial-strength systems. It shows you examples which you can reuse. 
			    It unleashes the true power of AOP through unique patterns of AOP design. When you are done, 
			    you will be eager-and able-to build new systems, and enhance your existing ones, with the help of AOP.

			    <p>Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) promises to increase the power of OO applications by 
			    modularizing functionality that cuts across classes (such as logging, transaction management,

		    &quot;Improve Modularity with Aspect-Oriented Programming&quot;</a> in the January 
		    2002 Java Technology Zone of IBM's Developer Works, by Nicholas Lesiecki
		</dt>
		<dd>&quot;Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a new 
		    programming technique that allows programmers to modularize <i>crosscutting 
		    concerns</i> (behavior that cuts across the typical divisions of 
		    responsibility, such as logging). AOP introduces <i>aspects,</i> which 
		    encapsulate behaviors that affect multiple classes into reusable modules. 
		    With the recent release of AspectJ by Xerox PARC, Java developers can now 
		    take advantage of the modularization AOP can provide. This article 
		    introduces AspectJ and illustrates the design benefits that result from its 
		    use.&quot;

		    Ramnivas Laddad
		</dt>
		<dd>&quot;Most software systems consist of several concerns 
		    that crosscut multiple modules. Object-oriented techniques for implementing 
		    such concerns result in systems that are invasive to implement, tough to 
		    understand, and difficult to evolve. The new aspect-oriented programming 
		    (AOP) methodology facilitates modularization of crosscutting concerns. Using 
		    AOP, you can create implementations that are easier to design, understand, 
		    and maintain. Further, AOP promises higher productivity, improved quality, 
		    and better ability to implement newer features. This article, the first in a 
		    three-part series, introduces the AOP concept and the problems it attempts 
		    to solve.&quot;

		</dt>
		<dd>&quot;AspectJ contains many very interesting language 
		    features and you may start looking for excuses to use them in your programs 
		    once you realize everything they make possible. AspectJ's authors recommend 
		    that you get started using aspects for writing, testing, and profiling code 
		    before moving on to make it an integral part of your production code base. 
		    AOP has many years to go before it becomes a mainstream programming

		<dd>&quot;It's not every day, or every year, that you come 
		    across something that makes you rethink your entire approach to 
		    programming.&nbsp; Mark my words, aspects are going to cause an epochal shift in 
		    programming right up there with the object shift of a decade ago. . . there 
		    is no question that within a few years, aspects will be as much a part of 
		    the programming lexicon as objects are today. . . AspectJ is the best tool 
		    to help Java programmers investigate an exciting programming concept whose 
		    time on the main stage of software development has come. Do yourself a favor 
		    - download it today.&quot;

		<dd>&quot;The first time I really grasped the wonderful 
		    power of object-oriented abstractions, I thought I'd seen the ultimate model 
		    on which all kinds of complex systems could be grown. . . However, I was 
		    wrong: There's something deeper, something that's truly beyond objects. 
		    Admittedly, this isn't a concept that's easy to explain, because I'm still 
		    so steeped in an object-oriented view of the world. However, just as a 
		    sailor can sense a changing sea, I note subtle signs that point to a marked 
		    transformation, a disruptive technology, on the horizon.&quot;

		    &quot;The Technology Review Ten: Untangling Code&quot;</a> in the January/February 
		    2001 issue of the Technology Review, by Claire Tristram

		<dd>&quot;Pity software engineers. With the touch of a 
		    button, their programs let us make global fixes in a long text, say, or a 
		    spreadsheet, yet programmers often need to correct their own work one 
		    tedious line at a time. That irony isn't lost on Gregor Kiczales, principal 
		    scientist at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and professor at the 
		    University of British Columbia in Vancouver—and he has a fix in mind. 
		    Kiczales champions what he calls &quot;aspect-oriented programming,&quot; a technique 
		    that will allow software writers to make the same kinds of shortcuts that 
		    those of us in other professions have been making for years. . .&quot;

		</dt>
		<dd>&quot;Aspect-oriented programming is a novel topic in 
		    the software engineering and languages communities.&nbsp; AOP appears to have the 
		    potential to significantly improve the reliability of programs, particularly 
		    by modularizing error-handling policies and allowing for easier maintenance 
		    and better reuse.&nbsp; In this article we introduce AspectJ, the first 
		    aspect-oriented programming language, and demonstrate how you can use it to 
		    construct more reliable software.&quot;

		<dd>&quot;Abstract: AOP defines a new program construct, 
		    called an aspect, which is used to capture corsscutting aspects of a 
		    software system in separate program entities.&nbsp; This article is divided into 
		    three parts: first, an explanation of the concepts of AOP; second, an 
		    introduction to AspectJ™, an implementation of the AOP concepts in Java; 
		    finally, a comparison of the AOP approach to metalevel programming.&quot;
