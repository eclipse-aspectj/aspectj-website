<h1>AspectJ 1.6.12 Readme</h1>

<p>The full list of resolved issues in 1.6.12 is available 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced;bug_status=RESOLVED;bug_status=VERIFIED;bug_status=CLOSED;product=AspectJ;target_milestone=1.6.12;">here</a></h2>.</p>


<h4>1.6.12.M2 available 18-Aug-2011</h4>
<h4>1.6.12.M1 available 7-Jun-2011</h4>


<h2>Notable Changes</h2>

<hr>
<h3>M2 - thisAspectInstance (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=239649">bug239649</a>)</h3>
<p>
There is now a new well known name that you can use in the if clauses in your aspects.  <tt>thisAspectInstance</tt> provides access to the aspect instance.

Here is an example:

<code><pre>aspect X {
  boolean doit() {
    System.out.println("In instance check method doit()");
    return true;
  }

  before():execution(* m(..)) && if(thisAspectInstance.doit()){
    System.out.println(thisJoinPoint);
  }
}</pre></code>

<p>Now why not just use <tt>X.aspectOf()</tt> instead of <tt>thisAspectInstance</tt>?  Well <tt>thisAspectInstance</tt> is quite useful 
when working with abstract/concrete aspects:

<code><pre>
abstract aspect X {
abstract pointcut p();

boolean doit() {
    return true;
  }

  before():p()  && if(thisAspectInstance.doit()){
    System.out.println(thisJoinPoint);
  }
}

aspect Y extends X {

  pointcut p(): execution(* m(..));

}</pre></code>

<p>Now <tt>thisAspectInstance</tt> will be an instance of the Y, not X.

It enables the aspect instance to be used in some kind of check/guard that will avoid the costly creation of a thisJoinPoint object if
the advice isn't going to run.

<b>Note:</b> right now this only works for singleton aspects.  If you have need of it with other instantiation models, please comment on

<h3>M2 - weaving groovy</h3>
<p>
Although we have been successfully weaving groovy for a long time, it is becoming more popular and a few issues have been uncovered
when using non-singleton aspects with groovy code.  These have been fixed.
</p>

<h3>M2 - AJDT memory</h3>
<p>
The release notes for the last few versions of AspectJ have mentioned two options (minimalModel and typeDemotion) which can be
switched on to reduce memory consumption.  They have had enough field testing now and from 1.6.12.M2 onwards they are on by default.
Users should see a reduction in memory consumed by AspectJ projects in AJDT.  It won't affect load time weaving.  It may also help
command line (or Ant) compile time weaving.  If these options cause a problem then please raise a bugzilla but in the interim you could
work around the problem by actively turning them off by 
specifying <tt>-Xset:minimalModel=false,typeDemotion=false</tt> in the project properties for your AspectJ project.
</p>

<h3>M2 - Java7 weaving support</h3>
<p>Some preliminary work has been done to support Java7.  Java7 class files must contain the necessary extra verifier support attributes 
in order to load successfully on a Java7 VM - the attributes were only optional in Java6.  It is possible to force loading of classes missing 
the attributes but that requires use of a -XX option.  AspectJ 1.6.12.M2 should create these for you if you weave Java7 level class
files.  Nothing has been done yet to rebase AspectJ on a version of the Eclipse compiler that supports Java7 language constructs - 
that will happen after Eclipse 3.7.1 is out.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>M1 - synthetic is supported in pointcut modifiers <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=327867">327867</a></h3>
<p>It is now possible to specify synthetic in pointcuts:
</p>
<pre><code>pointcut p(): execution(!synthetic * *(..));
</code></pre>

<h3>M1 - respect protection domain when generating types during weaving <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=328099">328099</a></h3>
<p>This enables us to weave signed jars correctly.  AspectJ sometimes generates closure classes during weaving and
these must be defined with the same protection domain as the jar that gave rise to them.  In 1.6.12.M1 this should
now work correctly.
</p>

<h3>M1 - Suppressions inline with the JDT compiler <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=335810">335810</a></h3>
<p>Starting with Eclipse 3.6, the Eclipse compiler no longer suppresses raw type 
warnings with @SuppressWarnings("unchecked"). You need to use 
@SuppressWarnings("rawtypes") for that.  AspectJ has now been updated with this rule too.
</p>

<h3>M1 - Optimized annotation value binding for ints <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=347684">347684</a></h3>
<p>The optimized annotation value binding now supports ints - this is for use when you want to match upon the existence of an annotation but
you don't need the annotation, you just need a value from it. This code snippet shows an example:</p>
<pre><code>@interface SomeAnnotation {
  int i();
}

before(int i): execution(* *(..)) && @annotation(SomeAnnotation(i)) {
</code></pre>
<p>
Binding values in this way will result in code that runs *much* faster than using pointcuts that 
bind the annotation itself then pull out the value.
</p>

<p>Under that same bug some changes were made to match values by name when binding too.  Suppose the annotation
had multiple int values, how would we select which int to bind?  AspectJ will now use the name (if it can) to select
the right value:
<pre><code>@interface SomeAnnotation {
  int mods();
  int flags();
}

before(int flags): execution(* *(..)) && @annotation(SomeAnnotation(flags)) {
</code></pre>
<p>Here the use of 'flags' as the name of the value being bound will ensure the 'flags' value from any SomeAnnotation is
bound and not the 'mods' value.</p>
