<h1>AspectJ Examples</h1>

<p>AspectJ examples are included in the doc/examples directory of your AspectJ installation. An archive file 
containing the examples only is also available for <a href="examples.zip">download</a>. Note that the build
file in the archive assumes relative paths in an AspectJ installation by default. Define the aspectj.lib.dir
property in your ant invocation to point to AspectJ libraries installed elsewhere.
