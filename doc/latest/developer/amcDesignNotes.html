<p>The key design goal is to do all the work inside the compile method of
the compiler (this makes life much easier for integration with the
rest of the JDT that, quite reasonably, expects the class files to be
ready for action once a compile has completed). The second design goal
is that it should be up to the requestor passed into the compiler
whether or not the class files actually get written out to disk
(different parts of the JDT pass in many different kinds of requestors
that do different things).</p>

<p><strong>Note on createWorldAndWeaver(classpath):</strong>
 We can probably avoid having to turn the Eclipse nameEnvironment
 into an externalized classpath by extending
 weaver.bcel.ClasspathManager to cope with "third party" managed
 classpath entries. On the eclipse side we can implement some
 interface and map it back into a call to INameEnvironment.findType -
 will need to cast returned IBinaryType into ClassFileReader, this is
 the only nasty. Much better than doing classpath nonsense though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note on handling the outjar option:</strong>
 This will be addressed by the requestor, if they want the results
 to go into an outjar, they can do so when accepting results. It will
 also have to be known by the piece of logic that moves resources (but
 that is outside of compile anyway).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note on handling sourceDirs:</strong>
 This is a command-line option only, and is handled by adding all
 the source files in the directories to the list of sourceUnits passed
 into compile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note on handling aspectpath:</strong>
 This is a list of directories and jar files containing class files
 to be added to the list of aspects. These class files will be added
 to the weaver&#8217;s list of added aspects at the start of the weave phase</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note on handling injars, inpath:</strong>
 These contain a set of class files that were not generated via
 parsing source, but instead are read directly from disk. We build a
 dummy CompilationResult in which getClassFiles() returns ClassFile
 objects for each of the class files. (Note, may need to define a
 ClassFile subclass with that just takes byte[] - this is a horrid
 hack but contained, and keeps the rest of the design clean).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note on handling -XnoWeave:</strong>
 Just skip the weave phase!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incremental compilation begins in the JavaBuilder with a request to
perform an incremental build. If the classpath of the project has
changed, or a binary project member (jar or .class file) has changed,
it reverts to a full build.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An IncrementalImageBuilder is then created and asked to build the
deltas since the last build. If this succeeds the new build state is

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is harder to get right than batch (surprise). We still want the
same two statements to hold at the end of the compilation of an
individual source file:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>all the class files have been written out and are ready to be used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all errors in any type defined in the file have been reported</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In both cases, the real 'incremental' logic is outside of the Compiler
itself (in IncrementalImageBuilder and in AjBuildManager). In the
current ajc case though, all compilation iterations have completed
before entering a single back-end weave phase. Pushing weaving inside
compile (as outlined in the proposal for batch building) makes this
design harder to accomplish in the new world. We are saved by the fact
that the current AspectJ incremental implementation currently only
supports one go round the loop before bailing out to a full build, and
we can mimic that behaviour easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The logic in AjState that currently updates the weaver with
addedClassFiles as compilation results are produced will have to be
moved into the compiler (adaptor), to occur between the intermediate
class file generation and the weaving phase.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_incremental_aspectj_compilation_in_eclipse">Incremental AspectJ Compilation in Eclipse</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JavaBuilder (one per project) will be responsible for managing the
bcelWorld and bcelWeaver. These will be passed to the Compiler
(Adaptor) prior to calling compile. The incremental build manager
which processes deltas will be responsible for informing the weaver of
deleted class files. Added class files are determined as compilation
progresses. Weaving will happen inside the compile method, as
described for batch, with the twist that the whole world may be
rewoven if the weaver feels this is necessary. To keep things
initially as close to the current AspectJ implementation as possible,
we will set the maximum loop limit to 1 in the IncrementalImageBuilder
so that we bail out to a full build if we don&#8217;t compile everything we
need in the first go. With a suitable test suite in place, there&#8217;s no
conceptual reason why we couldn&#8217;t put that back up to 5 (the JDT
default) as far as I can see right now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When performing a whole world weave, the compiler may end up asking
requestors to acceptResult()s that they didn&#8217;t request to be compiled,
but this is no different to the dependency analysis done on
referencing types that may then get added into subsequent incremental
loops in the JDT today.</p>

passes them to the compiler adaptor for it to call the weave method
rather than AjBuildManager calling weave directly as it does
today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note on handling aspectpath:</strong>
If the JavaBuilder detects that the aspectpath itself has changed in
any way, it will request a full build. If delta analysis during the
first phase of incremental compilation detects that a jar or class
file in an aspectpath has changed, it will bail out to a full build.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note on handling injars, inpath:</strong>
We must make sure that the delta analysis allows a project with only
an inpath change to proceed to building (rather than thinking that
there is nothing to do). Any changed jars or class files will have
their classes added to the weaver, and the weaver will be notified of
deletions too. We need to ensure that we still continue on to
compilation even when there are no "source files" in the work queue -
will need some design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>For tomorrow:</strong> start looking at refactoring AspectJ codebase itself to
fit the new shape, ahead of trying to do ImageBuilder integration at
the same time (in AspectJ, I have the test harness to guide me).</p>
