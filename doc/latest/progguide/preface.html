<h1>Preface</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This programming guide does three things. It</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>introduces the AspectJ language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>defines each of AspectJ&#8217;s constructs and their semantics, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides examples of their use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It includes appendices that give a reference to the syntax of AspectJ, a
more formal description of AspectJ&#8217;s semantics, and a description of
notes about the AspectJ implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first section, <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started with AspectJ</a>, provides a gentle overview of
writing AspectJ programs. It also shows how one can introduce AspectJ
into an existing development effort in stages, reducing the associated
risk. You should read this section if this is your first exposure to
AspectJ and you want to get a sense of what AspectJ is all about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second section, <a href="language.html">The AspectJ Language</a>, covers the features of the
language in more detail, using code snippets as examples. All the basics
of the language is covered, and after reading this section, you should
be able to use the language correctly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next section, <a href="examples.html">Examples</a>, comprises a set of complete
programs that not only show the features being used, but also try to
illustrate recommended practice. You should read this section after you
are familiar with the elements of AspectJ.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there are two short chapters, one on <a href="idioms.html">Idioms</a> and one
on <a href="pitfalls.html">Pitfalls</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The back matter contains several appendices that cover an
<a href="quickreference.html">AspectJ Quick Reference</a>, a more in depth coverage of
its <a href="semantics.html">Language Semantics</a>, and a description of the latitude enjoyed by
its <a href="implementation.html">Implementation Notes</a>.</p>
